        <h2>About this project</h2>
        
<p>



This project was inspired by the idea that a lot of information is being underutilized. One of this is video information, which normally just gets stored. Most businesses have CCTV footage for security purposes, but this information is not necessarily used by the company to ask important questions about their users, or to get feedback on business activity, which can increase the business’s revenue. 
<br>
<p></p>
While there are ways of calculating the total number of people who visit a business (There are tools such at google API popular hours that is based on the GPS signal from people’s devices),  there are limited tools that can quantify equipment usage right now. 
<br>
<p></p>
And again the data source is just sitting right there! 
<br>
<p></p>
I created this analysis tool to address this problem.
<br>
<p></p>
It takes in video information and converts this into regional time series activity maps that are based on regions of interest on your video screen. 
<br>
<p></p>
The simplest version is demonstrated in this app. Click around and you will find other use cases as well, such as parking lot tracking, and pet activity monitoring.
